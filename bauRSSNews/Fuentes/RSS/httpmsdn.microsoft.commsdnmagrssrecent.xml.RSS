<title>.NET Internals: Tailor Your Application by Building a Custom Forms Designer with .NET</title>
<link>http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/12/CustomFormsDesigner/</link>
<description>The design-time architecture of Windows Forms in the .NET Framework has made development much more flexible than it had been with MFC. With Windows Forms, you can drag one of your custom controls from the toolbox and drop it onto the Visual Studio design surface and even though Windows Forms knows nothing about the control, it's able to host it and let you manipulate its properties—not possible in MFC. In this article, the author discusses what's going on under the covers as you design your forms and then walks through the creation of a bare-bones forms designer.</description>

<title>.NET Code Tuning: Make Your Apps Fly with the New Enterprise Performance Tool</title>
<link>http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/04/12/EnterprisePerformance/</link>
<description>Because the common language runtime (CLR) is a black box, it's pretty hard to divine what's going on when you want to track down performance problems. Microsoft will be delivering a brand new profiler, the Enterprise Performance Tool (EPT), as part of Visual Studio 2005 Team Developer Edition that's ideal for use on a production system because it offers some very lightweight means of collecting performance data. Here John Robbins takes you on a tour.</description>
